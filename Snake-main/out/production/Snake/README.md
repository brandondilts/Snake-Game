# Snake


Final Project for CS:3210

Concept: Snake-like game

Description: We'd like to attempt to make our own version of the game called snake. The main goal of the game is to control a "snake's” direction with user inputs while the snake continuously moves forward for as long as possible without coming into contact with the wall or the snake's body. The snake will progressively get longer as it consumes blocks that spawn randomly on the stage after the previous is eaten, thus making it more difficult as the game goes on.

How to play: The user will be presented with a launch screen with a button that initiates the game when the user presses it. The snake will not move initially until the user presses the spacebar. The up, down, left, and right arrows control the snake's head. Aim for the red ball to collect food which will grow the snake's body after every ball is "eaten" and a scoreboard will keep a tally of the amount of balls consumed. 

Primary Features: 
• Snake movement controlled by cursor keys 
• Snake size increases per consumable 
• Game ends when snake either: 
  o Runs into wall 
  o Runs into own body

Stretch Goal 1 Features: 
• Different consumables 
  a. Increase / reduce snake size / reduce score 
• User select board size (difficulty) 
• Have the snake continuously moving in the last direction that was input so the game has some form of difficulty. 
• Add color to the consumables, snake body, and board. 
• Create point counter for every consumable consumed.

Stretch Goal 2 Features: 
• High Score scoreboard 
• Vary time consumables are available to be consumed
